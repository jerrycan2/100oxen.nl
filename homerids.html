<h5>Writing</h5>
<p>
    Writing a poem down originally had nothing to do with composing it. In archaic Greece, writing served one main purpose: preserving for posterity. In other cultures, including the Mycenean, administration was a major factor in the use and even invention of writing, in Greece there are no traces of that. The word sēma which Homer uses for written messages (Il 6.168) means "sign" with many applications but one of them is grave, tomb, grave-marker (Il 7.86-, 21.322, 23.255 and the "sēma" of a man long dead that serves as the turning point in the chariot race (Il 23.326-). The allusion is clear: the Iliad itself is a sēma, a grave marker for Patroclus, the best of the Achaeans (and of course for the poet himself). It must have been an exciting discovery for a poet: a way of preserving your work for posterity, where normally it would die with the singer. There may be apprentices, a younger generation, but they will sing their own poems, not yours. This brings us to a related function that a written text may have: it can be used for teaching.

<h5>The Homerids</h5>
<p>
    If you are a traditional professional singer you may have an apprentice who follows you around from performance to performance, carrying your lyre for you and trying to pick up the technique of epic singing by listening to many performances. This is not a very efficient method of learning and you probably cannot have more than one or two such apprentices in a lifetime. They will know the "formulas", the storylines and the technique of performing them before an audience but they will not know your composition by heart. So, what to do if you are a not-so-traditional world-famous singer who sets alight the people's enthusiasm wherever you go and young men come to seek you out because they want to learn this?<br>
    You start a school. You find a place out of the way of population centers but easily reachable and there you receive them and teach them your songs. For this you need a written copy for without that even a voice of bronze will not be strong enough to keep singing the songs to them. So firstly, you will have to teach them to read and write using your own poems. This works both ways, for your first pupils can then help you with the major task of writing down the complete poems. Several problems have to be solved: what to write on (cow- and sheepskin? see Hdt. 5.58), what to write with (a carefully shaped pen of olive wood, its point hardened in the fire?) and what to use for ink.<br>
    All this may give you the reputation of being the world's first schoolmaster and, since they do not know your real name, the nickname "Phoenix" because of the Phoenician letters you are always occupied with.

<h5>Chios</h5>
<p>
    Where would you live? You will want to be out of the way of powerful noblemen and cities who would use your fame for their own purposes. Therefore mainland Ionia and mainland Greece are not attractive, an island seems most suitable - somewhere in between those who live where the sun rises and those who live where it goes down. Since you are always anxious to hear news from your old hometown Smyrna, you will want to be near one of the main shipping routes. <br>
    Now there happens to be a fertile and wooded island stretched out before the Cyclops' harbour, not near nor very far...there are soft and well-watered meadows and a harbour where you can beach your vessel and stay until the wind becomes favourable...(Od 9.116-42).
    There is a place where those sailing the route north of Chios across the Aegean to Euboia (Od 3.170-) actually do that<a class="ptr">(1)</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Having finished the writing down of your magnum opus, the Iliad, and being too old to go on extensive travels like you used to, you spend your time composing a second large poem, meant to be performed by your pupils. Since none of them is able to string your lyre, they learn to beat the rhythm with a wooden staff. So they go to the festivals like Delos and funerals and win the tripods in the singing competitions.

    Il 18.373<a class="ptr">(2)</a> [...] τρίποδας γὰρ ἐείκοσι πάντας ἔτευχεν<br>
    ἑστάμεναι περὶ τοῖχον ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο,<br>
    χρύσεα δέ σφ' ὑπὸ κύκλα ἑκάστῳ πυθμένι θῆκεν,<br>
    ὄφρά οἱ αὐτόματοι θεῖον δυσαίατ' ἀγῶνα<br>

    He (Hephaistos) was making twenty tripods which stood by the wall of his well-built house
    and he was setting golden wheels under them, so they might go by themselves
    to the holy gatherings (or the meetings of the gods) and come back home again - a
    marvel to see. <br>
    They were indeed finished, except the artful ears had not yet been added
    and he was hammering to fix them.

    <li>Someday there will be a town called Volissos nearby where even in the far future people will still remember their old schoolmaster.</li>
    <li>
        Note that this little joke is in the Iliad, in the Shield of Achilles. This is a strong point in favour of the theory that Homer added pieces to the Iliad when he was writing it down.
