We study the poems, note a lot of    repeated phrases, write them down and notice that they appear usually in the same place in the hexameter. We make a    list of them, possibly alphabetize it and observe a rather strict economy in their use. But this is not how a singer    deals with them. To him, a phrase (formula) is not a collection of words but    <em>music</em>: they are phrases with a rhythm, (most likely) some kind of melody and a collection of meanings. The    rhythm automatically suggests a place in the hexameter. They are seen and remembered as units, the building blocks    of poetry. Hence, in analogy to 'phoneme' and 'morpheme' I would like to call them 'poeme' rather than formula. The    rhythm, melody (how I wish we knew more about that!) and meaning form an inseparable <em>idea</em><a        class="ptr">(2)</a>. My hypothesis is that the 'system' we find in Homer, is mostly an artifact of individual    memory: a collection of poemes from the memory of one man, selected for use in one poem. Naturally a lot of these    phrases are traditional and some are very old but they are <em>selected</em> for their meaning and applicability in    what the poet wishes to convey. He does not need more of them than he actually uses.</p><h4>Generics</h4><p>    All this still seems very restrictive. To see why this is our problem and not the poet's, we need to be aware of    another basic of Homeric poetry: these are <em>not novels</em>. In a modern novel, we tell a tale about <em>a</em>    man, Homer tells us about <em>the</em> man. Not about Achilles but about the <em>idea</em> of Achilles<a        class="ptr">(1)</a>.</p><p> Important for understanding this kind of poetry is to recognize that everything that is in focus at any moment,    becomes <em>generic</em>. 'Achilles' the character is as generic as his epithets and poemes. Every ship, arrow,    character or important concept like running, rowing and so forth can be lifted out of the immediate context, turn    into a metaphor and become a part of the subtext, the pseudo-hidden meaning which the poet is trying to convey.    Which brings us to the next item:</p><h4>Allegory and interpretation</h4><p>    To quote Umberto Eco: Allegory is metaphor which could be taken literally. We suspect its presence:<br>    a) because of convention <br>    b) because there must be relevance</p><br><p>    Convention is hardly accessible to us. All we can do is try to reconstruct some of it. But there is something else: allegory in Homer works 'by <a class="textlink" title="about likenesses" target="_self" href="<?php echo autoversion('/likenesses.php');?>">likeness</a><a class="ptr">(4)</a>', surface likeness, not    farfetched ones, taking it as an axiom that there are no dead metaphors in Homeric poetry. Everything is    consciously and purposefully included. In isolation this reconstruction of meaning is naturally a dangerously    subjective and unfalsifiable step. But we do know that they thought like that, I would go so far as to say that the    ancients <em>always</em> were aware of any metaphorical meaning in their words. You could say that their 'is-like-a'    was a more important classification operator to them than our 'is-a'. <br>    That leaves the touchstone of 'relevance'. Interpretation of any single part must make it relevant to the unity that    we seek. Here, I trust that if there are errors on the way, or if the whole concept is flawed, this will inevitably    show up as the impossibility to unify.</p><p>    <br><br></p><hr><ol id="footnotes">    <li>As prof. Nagy writes, 'the unity [..] may be the product of a lengthy evolution in the artistic streamlining of        form and content' (Nagy 1999, I.9). I feel that tradition may give us songs like the ones that Parry heard, but        not the Iliad. I would say that Homer selects from an enormously rich inheritance of traditions for his own        purposes, rather than that the poems are completely shaped by tradition.    </li>    <li>Not meant precisely in the Platonic sense but as unit of thought and meaning. A modern day analogy might be        improvised jazz where the skilled player is conscious of phrases rather than notes. In aoidic poetry as well as        in jazz, the split into words/notes is a habit of the less skilled, the ones who have not such a treasure trove        in their memory (Hesiod?).    </li>    <li>It is a strength of Homer that he can flesh out these ideas to become real live human beings. But the allegory        and genericity is still present in all the details.    </li>    <li>'Icon' means the same but I wish (for discussion elsewhere) to keep the religious connotations of this word        rather than the semiotic.    </li></ol><div class="mtime"><?="Last-Modified: ".gmdate("D, d M Y H:i", $lastModified)."
