<ul id="htxt">
    <li>select 'edit' checkbox, then click a treenode to start editing it. Node texts can be edited.
        <i>if you set the checkmark again after the edit frame is loaded</i>.
        The root node of the edit frame is not editable or deletable, it is needed to find the right place in the
        struct-tree.</li>
    <li>checkboxes english, greek, edit: determine what happens if you click a
        node-text: <i>toggle</i> Greek and/or translation (only nodes
        which cannot be expanded further) or if 'edit' checked: copy subtree to Edit.
        Avoid copying large trees to Edit, browsers do not deal with that very well.
    </li>
    <li>switch: switch between <em>Structure</em> View (whole tree, no Greek, yellow)
        and <em>Edit</em> View (subtree, incl. Greek, editable, blue) or both
    </li>
    <li>click on the circles star to view a short comment-text. In the Edit panel
        this is editable (see above). Comments attached to Greek textlines will of course
        not turn up in the 'struct' tree, but they will be stored in the html.
    </li>
    <li>expand: expand/collapse 'by level' the currently focused tree.</li>
    <li>Hide Greek: in Edit view, hide visible Greek textlines</li>
    <li>Insert: create a new node, with selected nodes as its children</li>
    <li>Delete: delete selected node(s), their children take their place</li>
    <li>Split: split the parent of selected nodes into two: first with the
        unselected children, second one with the first-selected and following
        nodes.
    </li>
    <li>Merge: append, to the first selected node, the children of the
        following selected node(s)
    </li>
    <li>Push: push the subtree in Edit on the stack.</li>
    <li>Pop: pop subtree from the stack and make it editable. Buttons
        Ins,Del,Split and Merge do an automatic 'undo' push before changing the tree.
        (this is not a real undo. Other mutations are not pushed automatically)
    </li>
    <li>Stack: you can also choose a subtree from the combobox</li>
    <li>Commit: write the current Edit subtree back into the Structure tree</li>
    <li>Colours: hide/show color panel
        <ul>
            <li>clicking on a color colors the selected nodes (colors of textlines
                can be set but are not saved)
            </li>
            <li>in 5 modes:
                <ul>
                    <li>none: all siblings the same color</li>
                    <li>left, up etc: siblings get the next left, up etc. color</li>
                    <li>if "turn' is selected, the selection creates an a-b-c-b-a color
                        pattern (use uneven nr. of nodes)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>if any nodes are selected when clicking on the nodetext, they will
                take that color (as if the color was clicked). Only if 'edit' is checked.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Load, Save: store/retrieve a (sub)tree to/from the user's device. It
        depends on Switch: if in Struct View, load to Structure panel etc. If no
        name is entered into the "save" box, one is generated.
    </li>
    <li>Bookmark: click on a linenumber (in Struct) to create a bookmark. Click on the
        bm. to go there, tree will expand as necessary. Click on bm. twice to delete.
        Bookmarks are remembered in browser storage. Click the button to delete all.
    </li>
</ul>
