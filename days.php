Day 1, or at least the "truce & duel" themata, clearly represent the past (its duels, Helen pointing out who is who). The middle day, the longest day, could very well represent the current situation of the Ionians or Smyrneans. The day of Achilles must be future, because surely there has not been such a day yet. So we have a "what was, what is and what will be" structure.    If we judge book 8 to have been there always<a class="ptr">(2)</a>, we get a 4-days-of-battle structure which is not an obvious reference, unless it be to a "three times...and the fourth..." kind of structure. The fourth always being decisive, as the Day of Achilles indeed is. There is something to be said for that, but the setup of the poem, its three-part structure, suggests rather more Kalchas' past - present - future scheme: 1. this is how it started (but Menelaos and Paris should have fought it out for themselves) - 2. this is how it is now (we are being defeated, we are using Patroclesses as if they were Achillesses) - 3. may Achilles come and save us (but he will not conquer Troy for us). This fits better with the "healing poem" character which I ascribe to the Iliad. <br>    It also fits better with my basic axiom number 3: the Iliad is about Homer's own time and place.    In that period, heroes were prayed to, worshipped, given gifts (votive offerings).    Especially, I imagine, in cities    that were under threat a nervous population would be asking the hero to save them. Homer takes    this seriously: in the person of Patroclus, he seems to suggest that Achilles is like    "a spirit that can possess people". It can make them fight angrily and relentless, forgetting    their own survival. Unclear is in what measure Homer is manipulating the image of Achilles.    Perhaps he was in origin just an icon a of a superman, an invincible warrior with an impenetrable    armour. Anyway, the result is an icon of a defensive hero, a "hero of the counter-attack".  </p>  <p>    Day 2 then, is the present. The Achaeans are losing the battle that they themselves started.    The wall is down, the ships are under threat. So why is Achilles not fighting for us, though    we have offered him many gifts? The answer has an ironical tone: Achilles is not helping us,    because by not helping and leaving us in the lurch until the last minute, he will be    given much more gifts than if he was fighting for us all the time.  </p>  <p>    Surely Day 3, the Day of Achilles, will come. Achilles' spirit will come down on some    Patroclus and he will single-handedly drive away the enemies. The war leaders were counting    on it and it always works because it is shameful to abandon your comrades under any circumstance    and shame is to be feared more than death itself.
