    <h1>Ring Composition</h1>
    <b>General:</b> <br>
    The summary page shows my view of an outline of the Iliad. I have divided
    the poem hierarchically into seven levels. This structure was made
    'bottom-up' by identifying the smallest topics I think the poet was talking
    about, gathering these into larger units and so forth.&nbsp; <br>
    The compositional technique (related to the well-known 'ring-composition')
    which I think the Poet applies on the higher levels, is a recursive
    principle one might call 'balanced expansion': a scene is added, but never
    on its own: one scene is inserted before, and one after the central scene.
    These two form a commentary on the central scene, and they are related to
    each other by 'likeness' or 'contrast' (which is a kind of negative
    likeness). This triplet can in its turn become the central part of a new
    triplet, also expanded in a balanced way. <br>
    This could reflect in some way a method of composition (of poems or other
    public speeches) that must have been common practice in those days. It helps
    the listener understand but it can also, importantly, serve as an
    aide-m√©moire to a singer who has to know it all by heart. <br>
    The same principles of symmetry and balance. turn up in the decoration of
    geometric vases (this one found in Smyrna, possibly Homer's birthplace,
    about the same date as his life):

    <p> Below the huge dipylon amphora, used as a grave-marker in Athens. Note
      the symmetry both vertical and horizontal. Also the 'summing up' quality
      of the story that is being told: a funeral with bier and a funeral
      procession. Each chariot, for instance, has two wheels and three horses so
      two wheels must be shown and twelve legs. A funeral bier or a chair has
      four legs, all of which must be shown. There is no attempt at realism,
      just a summing up of all the important parts of persons and things.</p>

    <p align="left"> A low-level example: Odysseus' speech in book IX, trying to
      persuade Achilles to help the Achaeans: </p>
    <p> 9.223 comments on the 'equal meal' <br>
      9.228 (a) we will perish if you don't fight <br>
      9.232 (b) Hector is here, raging <br>
      9.247 (c) save the Achaeans, you'll regret it if you don't <br>
      9.252 (d) Peleus' words: put away quarrels, friendliness is best, it gives
      honour... <br>
      9.259 (e) put away your anger <br>
      <b>9.264 (f) catalogue of gifts / these will be yours... </b> <br>
      9.299 (e) ...if you put away your anger <br>
      9.300 (d) but if you hate Agamemnon and his gifts... <br>
      9.303 (c) pity the Achaeans, for they honour you like a god <br>
      9.304 (b) now you can get Hector who is raging <br>
      9.305 (a) no one else is up to him </p>
    <p> Odysseus goes neatly from point to point till he reaches the central
      statement, the catalogue of gifts. Then he works back through a series of
      shorter points in reverse order to the starting statement: 'only you can
      do it'. <br>
      Not all is ring-structure though. Achilles, in his answer to Odysseus,
      goes through the same series of points twice: </p>
    <p> 9.307 (A) I will speak clearly - don't trick me <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.315 (a) gifts: I gave <i>him</i> much - others can
      keep it but not me <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.336 (b) wife: let him enjoy his own wife - he took
      Briseis, my prize <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.346 (c) I will not fight for defence <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.357 (d) I will go home to Phthia <br>
      9.367 (A) Aga. took my prize - tell him all this clearly - I will not obey
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.378 (a) gifts: I hate his gifts - not for 20 times as
      much... <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.388 (b) wife: I will not marry his daughter - find a
      wife in Phthia <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.401 (c) I will not fight for loot <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.410 (d) I will go home - tell the others to go, too <br>
      9.421 (A) Tell him all this clearly - think of another trick <br>
      <br>
      Another neat example of a repeated sequence on a somewhat larger level is
      in the embassies sequence at the end of book I: </p>
    <p> 1.306 Achilles in his hut <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.308 (a) A request: Agamemnon sends for Briseis
      (Achilles gives in, reluctantly) <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.348 (b) A complaint: Achilles complains to Thetis <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.430 (c) A meal and a reconciliation: Odysseus brings
      back Chryseis to her father <br>
      1.488 Achilles in his hut <br>
      1.493 After 12 days, the gods gather on Olympos <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.495 (a) A request: from Thetis to Zeus (Zeus gives
      in, reluctantly) <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.536 (b) A complaint: Hera complains to Zeus <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.571 (c) A meal and a reconciliation: Hephaistos makes
      peace - meal on Olympos <br>
      1.605 At sunset, the gods retire to their homes <br>
      <br>
      In these last two examples we find the alternative priciple of
      composition: the <b>list </b>(catalogue)<b>. </b>A list is a simple
      sequence of similar topics: e.g. the catalogue of ships and men, the
      individual games in Patrocles' funeral games, the Epipolesis in book IV,
      etc. <br>
