Life of Homer

* Born first half 8th c. in Smyrna ("Melesigenes") into a branch of the Neleid family
* these were a royal family from Pylos who claimed descendancy from Poseidon. They were very involved in the Ionian Migration (via Athens). [find ref in Hdt.]
* father: 'king' of the city, occupant of the Big House in Smyrna (ref. Akurgal) (like Peleus)
* grandfather: the man who stole the city from the Aeolians ("Lykorgos") ref.Herodotos
* mother: a bought concubine (like Thetis) . Is the only son for many years. His father treats him as a successor.
* Is from an early age (shield scene) a talented singer, kithara-player and speechmaker in his father's service. But military prowess counts for more.
* younger halfbrother, born from the wedded wife (like Hera?) when H. was already at least a teenager ("Achilles") 
* The younger brother is to become king ("Achilles is nobler than you") (Notos - theme)
H. will be 'commander of the army'? (Diomedes vs. Aineias scene)
* Quarrel with father & brother about politics: goes into exile (Phoenix' , Patrocles' story etc.)
(they must have justified their capture of Smyrna by claiming that they would conquer "Troy" (Sardis) for the Greeks. They were not able to do this, in Homer's view.)
* Ionia is by then 'full', with no prospect of growing larger. Economic crisis.
* Swears off his name (deal with family?). Then 40 years old.
* Goes to Kyme. Meets Hesiodos (there?) ("Aeolos") (ref. Life of Homer). 
* Joins a kind of aristocratic reform movement trying to bring stability to Hellas. Connected to:  'Panhellenic Revival', Founding of Delphi; Olympic religion (body of texts); suspending the "Trojan War" & substituting westward emigration; Lykurgus' reforms in Sparta after the 1st  Messenian War?; Lelantine War? ; Phoenician influence (city states, temples)? (ref Hdt 2.52)
* Sings (the Iliad or a precursor of it) for a large royal audience at "Amphidamas' funeral" in Chalkis (ref. "Contest of H.& H.")
* Travels extensively, singing the Iliad everywhere
* Finally settles in Chios (Volissos). Has a daughter. ("Nausikaa")
* 'school forming' as with later philosophers. Becomes a kind of  teacher to admirers from all over Greece.
* Founds the Guild of Singers, the Homeridae. Composes the Odyssee, meant to be performed by his pupils. 
* sings at Delos? (-> Hymn to Apollo)
* To facilitate training his rhapsodes, he creates written texts of both large poems (revising the Iliad?) (adapting the alfabet: creating long  and  for the purpose) 
* Has problems with eyesight in old age. The one who marries his daughter will be leader of the Homeridae ("Who can string my bow?")
* Dies: end 8th/early 7th c. ?


What Homer wants

1. To redefine the concept of "Hero" as one who fights and dies for his community and not (only) for his own glory.
2. It is stressed that this glory, if it is to be real, entails his possible death.
3. And he must obey his commander, even though this commander be no hero.
4. But the commander must not be arrogant: he must seek advice from the council and put the matter before the Agora to vote yes or no.
5.
