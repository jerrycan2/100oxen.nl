<h2>Kronos and justice</h2>
<h4>the succession myth (Th 453-)</h4>
<p>
    Kronos and Rhea were the parents of a younger generations of gods. Kronos however, having heard
    a prophecy that his own son was to depose him, swallowed all his children. Rhea was grieved.
    When the youngest, Zeus, was about to be born, Rhea went in hiding in Crete and hid the baby there
    in a cave. She gave Kronos a stone wrapped in a blanket instead and he swallowed it down<a class="ptr">(5)</a>. Grown up, Zeus vanquished Kronos and made him vomit up all the gods.
    This act made him ruler in heaven.

    The myth is an obvious borrowing from Hurrian or Babylonian myths. M.L. West prefers an early date for the transmission, Minoan or Mycenean, among other things on the grounds that the story is completely absorbed into Greek tradition: names of the gods and of places are completely hellenized. West asks the question:
</p>
<div class="indent">
    <p>"Is it to be supposed that at the very beginning of the orientalizing period a complete theological myth was taken
        over bodily from some Near Eastern source, translated completely into Greek terms, and immediately retailed by
        Greek poets and the very priests at Delphi?"<a class="ptr">(6)</a></p>

    I would say yes, that is exactly what they were doing, not only with this myth but with the whole Olympic religion, the city-state politeia, the Panhellenic revival, the alphabetic script,
    the building of stone temples, not to mention the Great Epics. All of it gives an impression
    of being a
    loose adaption of some Near Eastern (Phoenician?) know-how of organizing a modern state. To be sure,
    there must have been religion in post-Mycenean Greece. Important to the people but formless, local,
    based on traditions about gods, people and places that we still find in the Olympian <em>kosmos</em>
    but relegated to the lower echelons. The new religion was not traditional, it was consciously
    created (using preexisting names of gods) for political purposes. These people knew exactly
    what they were saying and why.
