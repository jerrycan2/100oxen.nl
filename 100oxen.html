    <h1>One hundred oxen</h1>
    <p class="100oxen">...is the number of animals slaughtered and sacrificed to
      the gods on very special occasions. The name for it is 'hecatomb
      (ἑκατόμβη)' which literally means '100 oxen'. Such a huge sacrifice was
      meant to impress both gods and men with the richness of it and it was
      performed only rarely. 'Slaughter' is the keyword here: this website is
      about the Iliad and the Iliad is, or rather describes, an enormous
      slaughter. Anyone who tried to read it knows it well: the poem seems an
      endless sequence of very formalized sword and spear duels, interspersed
      with dialog scenes by gods and men. Why read it? This website hopes to
      give a beginning of an answer.
    </p>
    <h4>100 oxen</h4>
    <p>is also the name of this website. I chose it because it fits the Iliad
      very well and because of a joke Homer makes in book 6 (Il 6.119-): here
      the great hero Diomedes meets an equally great warrior from the Trojan
      side, Glaucos, on the battlefield. Before they fight, they do the usual
      boasting of their
      prowess and lineage and it turns out that their families have old ties.
      They choose not to fight each other and exchange armor instead (the enemy
      armor that you gain in battle is a measure of your worth as a warrior) .
      Glaucos has <em>golden</em>&nbsp; armor, a sure sign of superhero status,
      and Homer comments: Glaucos must have lost his wits because he exchanged
      armor worth a hundred oxen, for a bronze one worth only nine (ἑκατόμβοι᾽
      ἐννεαβοίων = a hundred oxen for nine). This is an ironical comment on
      Diomedes' too-good-to-be-true way of becoming a superhero - the likelihood
      of making a deal like that. Because of his likeness to and contrast with
      Achilles I called the first part of the structure after him: 'the immortal
      hero'. This phrase 'a hundred oxen for nine' also means: 'a hecatomb for
      nine oxen' which is exactly the whole Iliad in 2 words. The Iliad is like
      a hecatomb, the nine oxen are like Achilles plus Agamemnon's council :
      Agamemnon and Menelaos (the old king, the young king), Nestor and Odysseus
      (the old Councillor, the young(er) one), the two Aiantes (the greater, the
      lesser), Idomeneus and Diomedes (the old hero, the young one). These eight
      are the main Greek actors in the story; they are also the eight little
      birdies eaten, plus Achilles the mother-bird, by the snake in Kalchas'
      prophecy as told by Odysseus in Il 2.308-.

    <p class="100oxen">The above paragraph is an example of how I propose to
      tackle the Iliad: the poem is to be understood&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">by
        likeness</span>. I shall happily ignore modern theories about the
      futility of this exercise and proceed with an analysis of the Iliad
      governed by simple likenesses of 3 kinds: internal, external and
      reflexive.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Internal: an example of the <em>Homerum ex Homero</em> principle. I
        have tried to analyze the poem 'bottom-up' by taking short sequences of
        hexameters and organize them by topic, trying to formulate 'what it is
        about' for every group and gathering them recursively into larger parts
        based on likeness and contrast, looking for symmetry and
        ring-composition and forming a hierarchical structure. The result is on
        the <a class="textlink showlist" title="main page" href="#">main page</a>,
        where I hope to demonstrate this internal poetical structure of the
        Iliad, a 'structure of ideas'. This structure is probably not there for
        the benefit of the audience but functions as a sort of mnemonic
        structure which helps the poet to organize and remember his material.
        More on the theory behind it <a class="textlink" title="ring composition"

          href="ring.html">here</a>. It has to be said, the determination 'what
        it is about' is naturally not separable from interpretation,
        therefore subjective. But because the parts of the structure are related
        by likeness and/or contrast, this gives us a clue what the poet is
        talking about in his own mind. An example is the correspondence Diomedes
        - Achilles. It tells us that the poet is <em>contrasting</em> these two
        heroes and that is an important pointer for the interpretation of the
        whole poem. </li>
      <li>External: On the simplest level: the myriad simple
        metaphors, similes and comparisons which make up a large part of Homeric
        language. I shall call them all 'likeness' to avoid theoretical
        complications which are of no interest here. The intention of this
        language-use is to create a "semi-hidden" level of meaning, apart from
        the literal. More about this plus a dictionary of the most important
        ones <a class="textlink" title="a discussion of 'likeness'" href="http://100oxen.nl/likenesses.html">here</a>.<br>
        On the largest level,&nbsp; there is a correspondence between the
        situation of the Achaean army in the Iliad&nbsp; with the political
        situation in Ionia in the 8-7th century. </li>
      <li>Reflexive: looking at the possibility that the Iliad and especially
        the Odyssey have a lot to say about themselves, their public and their
        poet(s). The reflexivity, if accepted, would make a strong case for a
        unitarian view but there are other possibilities, too. </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="100oxen">Before beginning, let me go through the set of
      unprovables, the axioms that determine the rules of interpretation in this
      Homeric cosmos:</p>
    <button class="accordion">The Iliad was created by one poet and forms a
      poetic <em>unity</em>.
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>This means that every line, every scene is in the service of this and
        we will not allow for digressions, interpolations etc. which go outside
        this unity. I know that this can never be 100% true as 1) it is impossible,
        in view of the complicated history of the poem, to think that we possess
        the exact text that the poet used to sing (if there ever was such a
        thing) and 2) given the huge cultural distance between us and them, we can
        never be sure of any interpretation. But we should start from the assumption 
        that everything in it is relevant and intentional.&nbsp; <br>
        It must be clear that the Iliad is <em>not a novel</em>.
        It is not about character, it is about <em>action</em> (Aristotle said this).
        Action is not determined by individual character but by <em>position</em>.
        With 'position' I mean the sum of the forces acting upon a person when
        he/she is making a decision, such as social status and expectations of
        others but also, in Homeric terms, a choice 'which god to obey'. About
        the gods <a class="textlink" title="what we obey" href="thegods.html">here</a>.
        I do not mean to say that the characters in the poem are only types. Homer is too
        good a poet for that. We could say they are not without character, but individual
        character is not the driving force of their actions. The gods are.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Homer sings about his own world</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p> This axiom says that the Iliad (also) refers
        to a historical reality outside itself and outside the world of myth. We
        may not know very much about it, but we must apply all of our historical and
        archaeological knowledge to aid the interpretation of this poem. The
        consensus seems to be for a date (of the Iliad) in the late 8th-early
        7th century so we will have to look for facts from that time at the
        latest.<br>
        We presume that a poet in the 8-7th c. composed one or two poems to comment on events and
        developments in his own world and that he used and adapted well-known
        stories from the world of myth to express his ideas, <em>and also to
        hide them</em>. This was in the archaic Greek world and earlier
        (non-literate societies) a common use of myth. One example of this use is
        the political use of <a class="textlink" href="summary.html">charter-myth</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Crucial for understanding the Iliad is to
      see its <em>rhetoric</em>.
    </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p> On one level, this poet really is a master-manipulator of pathos. 
        We must imagine his public as mainly young, male, aristocratic (all little Achillesses), eager for
        honor and glory and very much pro-Greek. This is the public the literal
        level of meaning is aimed at: a public wildly enthusiastic about the
        very battle scenes that we find so boring. He could control their pity
        and fear (another Aristotle reference here) as well as other
        emotions like no other poet could. 'Learning by pathos' is the keyword
        here.<br>
        On another rhetorical level, it is a sharp criticism of Ionian politics
        of his day. This is aimed at 'kings and prominent people' (ref. Il
        2.188-207), generally those who understand allusion and irony. For this
        audience, the Iliad is meant to function as a<em> speculum regis</em>, a
        king's mirror. It becomes the 'ethical constitution' of the city-state,
        Sparta in its early days is probably the best example of that. </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">These remarkable <em>gods</em> belong to the
      Iliad only</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p> They belonging to that poem and to that poet only. This view of the
        gods is not characteristic of the Greeks in general, must have been
        controversial even in Homer's day and is much normalized in the Odyssey.
        The divine-human interaction and especially the so-called 'double
        determination' of human actions are created by Homer to explain
        something to us concerning character, fate and justice. The most
        important background story for this is the 'Judgement of Paris', the
        prelude to the Trojan War. </p>
