    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This is an experimental website about the Iliad; it is experimental in
      two ways: as a programming project, to see how best to present this
      content (I am an amateur programmer, just learning to do this because I
      like to), but mainly as an experiment in literary analysis of the poem, to
      see how far I get trying to build a 'structured summary' of the whole poem
      and how this influences interpretation. In both dimensions of the
      experiment, there will be errors, malfunctions and sudden structure
      changes as I change my mind about the best approach. Please be patient and
      communicate problems (of any kind) to me.</p>

    <h2>A hundred oxen</h2>
    <p>A hundred oxen for slaughter, a hecatomb, that is the Iliad. A feast for
      the dogs and birds, a giant cup full of strong intoxicating wine, a vision
      of our world that only an Achilles can bear to look at, a healing
      song.&nbsp; A fierce, angry poem which does not have its equal. The
      ancient Greeks were completely bowled over when it first hit them though
      whether they 'got the message' is another question. In these pages I hope
      to show that the Iliad really is a poem with a message and Homer a kind of
      prophet. His mission statement is here:</p>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
      <p>(il 24.173) ... Διὸς δέ τοι ἄγγελός εἰμι,</p>
      <p>ὅς σευ ἄνευθεν ἐὼν μέγα κήδεται ἠδ' ἐλεαίρει.</p>
      <p>λύσασθαί σ' ἐκέλευσεν Ὀλύμπιος Ἕκτορα δῖον,</p>
      <p>δῶρα δ'Ἀχιλλῆϊ φερέμεν τά κε θυμὸν ἰήνῃ</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
      <p>'...I am a messenger from Zeus,</p>
      <p>who, although far away, is concerned and pities you</p>
      <p>He orders you to ransom the great Hector,</p>
      <p>bringing gifts to Achilles to melt his heart' (Iris to Priam)</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>The gifts are the same gifts, the <i>ἀπερείσι᾽ ἄποινα</i> (immeasurable
      ransom) that the priest of Apollo Chryses brings to ransom his daughter in
      book 1. The ransom, of course, is the poem itself. Achilles is its
      addressee and Homer is thus on a mission to visit all Achilleses in Hellas
      and 'melt their heart', teach them:</p>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
      <p>(il 9.496) ἀλλ᾽ Ἀχιλεῦ δάμασον θυμὸν μέγαν: οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ</p>
      <p> νηλεὲς ἦτορ ἔχειν...</p>
      <br>
      <p>'Conquer your great passions, Achilles. There is no need</p>
      <p>for you to have a pitiless heart...'&nbsp; (Phoenix to Achilles)</p>
      <br>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <p>He wants them to know compassion, to recognize the enemy as a human
      being. He wants them to be able to weep for Hector, the enemy, and for
      this purpose he paints Hector as a <i>real </i>hero, fighting for
      defense of his wife, child and city. He pulls out all the emotional stops
      to gain that result. All the while he has to maintain the greatness and
      honor of Achilles, his public would never let him give 'equal honor' to
      both heroes (il 24.55-).</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>For this, he created a guild of rhapsodes, the Homeridae, selected from
      enthousiastic young men who came to visit his 'school'. He (or they) wrote
      down the Iliad and the Odyssey for easier teaching and as a monument for
      later generations. So he became not only The Poet but also the first
      schoolmaster.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>In order to explain how I came to this interpretation, I have to discuss
      the following characteristics of the poetry:</p>
    <button class="accordion">1. Rhetoric: persuasive rhetoric on two
      levels:</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Just like Odysseus in his efforts to calm down the people in book 2 (il
        2.188-206), Homer uses a two-pronged attack:</p>
      <p>a)<b> learning by pathos</b>. We must imagine his public as mainly
        young, male, aristocratic (all little Achillesses), eager for honor and
        glory and very much pro-Greek. This is the public that the literal level
        of meaning is aimed at: wildly enthusiastic, the heart swelling with
        pride with every Greek heroic act. He could control their pity and fear
        (another Aristotle reference here) as well as other emotions like no
        other poet could. This way of frightening them in submission, as
        Odysseus does and as Homer does with Achilles, was attacked by Plato who
        called it 'being courageous through fear' meaning fear of shame. The
        Iliad is very much a poem about shame:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
        <p>ὣς Ἀχιλεὺς ἔλεον μὲν ἀπώλεσεν, οὐδέ οἱ αἰδὼς</p>
        <p>γίγνεται, ἥ τ᾽ ἄνδρας μέγα σίνεται ἠδ᾽ ὀνίνησι. (Il 24.44, Apollo to
          the gods)</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>So Achilles has killed Pity, nor does he feel Shame</p>
        <p>which so greatly hurts and benefits mankind</p>
      </div>
      <p></p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>Both the hurt and the benefit are treated in depth in the figures of
        Achilles and Hector.</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>b) <b>the allusive level</b>. Here is a sharp criticism of Ionian
        politics of his day and especially of the Helen-myth. It is aimed at
        'kings and prominent people' (ref. Il 2.188), generally those who
        understand covert allusion and irony and who are 'shepherds' (or
        swineherds) rather than 'sheep'. For this audience, the Iliad is meant
        to function as a<em> speculum regis</em>, a king's mirror. It becomes
        the 'ethical constitution' of the city-state, with 'ethics' meaning
        'this is how we are'. </p>
      <p> This manner of speaking, the use of language with both public and
        private meanings, has been named <em>sympotic language</em>. Plato was
        a master of this (ref. the Symposium) but all well-educated men (which
        probably meant aristocrats in Homer's day) could probably deal with it
        to some degree.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">2. The Iliad is about about Homer's own
      time and place:</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The Iliad refers to a historical reality outside itself and outside the
        world of myth. We presume that a poet in the 8-7th c. composed one or
        two poems to comment on events and developments in his own world and
        that he used and adapted well-known stories from the world of myth to
        express his ideas, <em>and also to hide them</em>. This was in the
        archaic Greek world and earlier (non-literate societies) a common use of
        myth. One example of this use is the political use of <a class="textlink"

          href="summary.html">charter-myth</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">3. Internal structure: they are very
      carefully crafted, unified texts, the Iliad more so than the Odyssey. </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>A thing which never fails to impress me about the Iliad is its clarity
        and well-formedness. Its language runs smoothly off the tongue, its
        ideas are presented in an easy to understand, straightforward way. Its
        paratactic style, its use of epithets and type-scenes all make it easy
        on the listener. All-pervasive ring-composition also has a lot to do
        with this clarity and this website aims to bring this out. </p>
      <p>If you think of 'oral composition' not as well-rehearsed improvisation
        but as an author creating a poem inside his head, knowing it by heart
        and carrying it around with him from performance to performance, the
        reason for this refinement is clear: the poet had ample time to adapt
        and clarify his creation based on his own experience performing and
        discussing it. The tale 'grew in the telling' and what we have is the
        mature form. Traces of this 'growing' are visible, more about this
        elsewhere.</p>
      <p>This oral-composition hypothesis is related to the poetic structure
        that I wish to bring out: to compose a huge poem without writing, I
        think you need a clear structural skeleton to build your poem on, a
        mnemonic aid and an ordered way of setting up your story. This is what I
        think this 'structured summary' is a trace of. It is not a formal
        structure, it is not even meant for the listener, but for the poet
        himself. Interestingly, trying to trace such a structure in the Odyssey
        does not succeed. It is peculiar to the Iliad and even in this poem it
        is not equally apparent everywhere. My guess is that the Odyssey is not
        oral but composed with the help of writing. The Iliad came first and was
        written down or dictated at some point but its original composition was
        by memory only. More about this <u>here</u>.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">3. Their self-reflectiveness: in spite of their
      anonimity, the poems are very self-aware (the Odyssey even more so than
      the Iliad)</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The Iliadic centre of self-reflection is the lyre-playing god of
        prophecy, healing and poetry Apollo: 'the Destroyer', 'Silverbow',
        'Far-shooter'. If the Iliad is a tour-de-force of poetry then, in some
        sense, the god of poetry must be acting through it. And it is a healing
        poem: it aims to heal not only 'Achilles' but Ionian society in general
        which must have been under pressure in Homer's day. Also it is a
        prophecy: go too far and you'll all be dead. </p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">4. These remarkable <em>gods</em> are to
      be taken seriously and they belong to the Iliad only</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p> They belong to that poem and to that poet only. Homer takes the gods
        very seriously indeed but his view of the gods is not naive and not
        characteristic of the Greeks in general. It must have been controversial
        even in Homer's day and is much normalized in the Odyssey. The
        divine-human interaction and especially the so-called 'double
        determination' of human actions are created by Homer to explain
        something to us concerning human character, fate and justice. The most
        important background story for this is the 'Judgement of Paris', the
        prelude to the Trojan War. </p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="100oxen">It must be clear that the Iliad is <em>not a novel</em>.
      It is not about character, it is about <em>action</em> (Aristotle said
      this). Action here is not determined by individual character but by <em>position</em>.
      With 'position' I mean the sum of the forces acting upon a person when
      he/she is making a decision, such as social status and expectations of
      others but also, in Homeric terms, a choice 'which god to obey'. About the
      gods <a class="textlink" title="what we obey" href="thegods.html">here</a>.
      I do not mean to say that the characters in the poem are only types. Homer
      is too good a poet for that. We could say they are not without character,
      but individual character is not the driving force of their actions. The
      gods are. </p>
