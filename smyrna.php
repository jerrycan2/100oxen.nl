    <p>Old Smyrna by the end of the 7th century - long after Homer - when it was at its largest.
        In total some 500-600 houses (3000 people) may have stood here at that
        time. The harbour on the left is the mouth of the Meles river. Note how
        the houses "fill the mouth of the shore between the two headlands" (Il
        14.35-). Also note that Smyrna has two harbours, like the city of the
        Phaeacians in the Odyssey. The view is due South from the flanks of Mt.
        Sipylos.</p>

    <p>
        Archeaological remains of the 'big house' in Smyrna. A cluster of huts round a courtyard, no doubt walled, where
        in all
        probability the "king" of the city must have lived with his family, servants and slaves.
        It is impossible to date these relative to Homer's lifetime, but his life could very well
        have spanned the situations between Abb. 15 and 19.
        In 15 we have a cluster of round huts. Recognizable are building C: the big megaron, only partly visible,
        which must have been the main building. Behind this, there is a cluster d, e and f which were connected
        and formed the oldest multi-room building known from this area. At the left and top (not visible) there were
        many buildings for diverse purposes, probably servants work- and sleeping huts.<br>
        On the right-hand side there is a large walled space (XXXVIII), larger than is visible here, with a
        round building (j) in the middle: a tholos, see above. It was not roofed over.
        Akurgal estimates the size of this walled area more than 100 m2. It was too small to serve as an
        agora but could have been used for gatherings such as the ones in Odysseus' house. It even had a small round
        podium (Â± 1m.) on the west wall.
