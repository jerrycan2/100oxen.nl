    <p>In the Iliad, Apollo is patron of poetry, healing, prophecy and archery.
      If Apollo is the patron of poetry, at least certain kinds of poetry, and
      the Iliad is that kind of poetry, then Apollo must be in some sense 'the
      god behind the Iliad'. I will argue that the Iliad is a <span style="font-style: italic;">healing
        song</span>, a paean (as in Il 22.391 : νῦν δ᾽ ἄγ᾽ ἀείδοντες παιήονα
      κοῦροι Ἀχαιῶν on having killed Hector) and therefore properly belongs to
      Apollo. </p>
    <p>A paean is a song to cure an illness or to give thanks for a successful
      cure. As the above example in book 22 shows, this need not be a cure of a
      person, it can also be of the community. A community under siege, for
      instance, may be stressed, fearful, nervous, 'feverish' and many more
      things. To get rid of this unbearable stress they may offer votive gifts
      to mythical heroes who in the past did save their people from similar
      disasters. A wise local leader might order a bard to sing appropriate epic
      tales to boost their courage and give them hope. The best cure of course
      would be military: a successful chasing-away of the enemy would be the
      best cure of all and this is what Achilles (Patroclus) does, and this is
      why he is Achilles the Healer.<br>
