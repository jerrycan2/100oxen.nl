    The post-Homeric, reasonable argument that in the real world, the Trojans would never
    have suffered her to stay there and would have kicked her out of the city, remains a
    somewhat weak point in the Iliadic setup. When the Trojan elders say: "beautiful as
    she is, let her sail away (Il 3.159)", it shows that Homer is aware of this point. Why doesn't she?
